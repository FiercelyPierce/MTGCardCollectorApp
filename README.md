# Overview

I am trying to make an app that displays cards that I add to the database, but right now it just holds a few images and I can get one of them to pop up.

I want it to work dynamically with my webpage that I made for my last project a couple of weeks ago. After adding cards to the database through the webapp, I want to view them here in the mobile app version.

# Development Environment

I used Android Studio to develop the app

I used Java for the entierty of it.
